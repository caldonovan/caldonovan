### Hi there 👋

I love experiencing and exploring the latest tech trends, building useful applications and making people's lives easier.

Some things that are keeping me entertained:

- 🎓 Currently studying an MSc in Advanced Software Technology.
- 📝 Most of my time is dedicated to my dissertation.
- ⚡ Currently working on an API using Lumen.
- ⚗ Experimenting with .NET apps & JAMStack.
- ⭐ My favourite technologies at the moment include **[Laravel]()** & **[VueJS]()**.
