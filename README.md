## Hi there 👋

I love experiencing and exploring the latest tech trends, building useful applications and making people's lives easier.

Some things that are keeping me entertained:

- 🎓 Currently studying an MSc in Advanced Software Technology.
- 📝 Most of my time is dedicated to my dissertation.
- ⚡ Currently working on an API using [Lumen 7](https://lumen.laravel.com/).
- 🚀 Also working on a full-stack app using [Laravel 7](https://laravel.com/) & [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).
- ⚗ Experimenting with .NET apps & [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/).
- ⭐ My favourite technologies at the moment include **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/)** & **[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)**.
